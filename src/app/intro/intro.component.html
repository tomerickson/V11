  <p>To make full use of this and the other database tables, a good grasp of SQL is essential.</p>
  <p>But note that it, <a href='http://www.nanosoft.co.nz/TwoToTwo.php'>TwoToTwo</a> and <a
      href='http://www.nanosoft.co.nz/Fission.php'>Fission</a> is each dedicated to querying only one of two tables.</p>
  <p>The "universal" program <a href='http://www.nanosoft.co.nz/AllTables.php'>All Tables</a> can accept full SQL
    commands
    that query any of the 12 "Parkhomov" tables, together with the "ElementProperties", "Nuclides", "RadioNuclides" and
    "Atomic Radii" tables as well.</p>
  <p>You may indicate which of the three neutrino conditions to include: "left" and/or "none" and/or "right". The
    default
    condition is include all three.</p>
  <p>In all the above tables, except the Periodic, each atom, in either the input or the output, as well as its 'A' and
    'Z' numbers now also has a 'nBorF' ('nuclear Boson or Fermion') and a 'aBorF' ('atomic Boson or Fermion') parameter
    associated with it.</p>
  <p>An atom's nucleus is considered a Boson ('b') if its A number is even; if odd a Fermion ('f'). The atom itself is
    considered a Boson ('b') if its number of neutrons (A - Z) is even; if odd a Fermion ('f').</p>
  <p>These parameters can be used either passively, by observing the distributions of 'b' and 'f' in inputs and/or
    outputs, and/or actively, by selecting 'b only', 'f only' or 'either' in the boxes below.</p>
  <p>NB: To avoid unnecessary duplication in all Fusion tables, A1 is never greater than A2 in any row,
    i.e.
    A1 <= A2. This also applies implicitly in that, if the input side of the Core Query only involves E1 and E2, only
      rows whose associated mass numbers obey A1 <=A2 will appear in the results</p> <form id='f'
      action='https://www.nanosoft.co.nz/Fusion.php' method='post'>
      <input type='hidden' name='doit' value='execute_query' readonly />
      <p>To protect the table, only SQL compatible "selection" queries can be allowed and you must enter
        only the CORE part of that query.</p>
      <p>Once you do this and click on the "Execute Query" button, the front part (here "select * from FusionAll where
        ")
        will be automatically prepended and the full query sent to the database.</p>
      <p>Latest: All queries will now be limited to 1000 possible rows of results; any requested 'limit'
        greater than 1000 will be reset to 1000; to any core query not including any 'limit' command will be appended
        'limit 1000'.</p>
      </form>
